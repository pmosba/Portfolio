The purpose of this project was to develop a predictive model that is able to predict the Amazon stock price based on the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Both Amazon stock share prices and the number of cases have seen a similar increasing trend since last March. I created the model in this project to help in predicting the trend in Amazon stock prices, which will be important as the number of cases is likely to begin trending downward due to more citizens becoming vaccinated.
