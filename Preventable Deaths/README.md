The purpose of this project was to see raceâ€™s role in preventable deaths. Furthermore, are Black Americans at a higher risk of dying from a preventable death than White Americans? If so, could a lack of healthcare and a higher poverty level be a potential cause of that? Health risk factors such as obesity and tobacco-use will be examined for each race as well as socio-economic factors such as being uninsured and unemployed. Preventable deaths for each race will also be examined and the following are those that the study will focus on: HIV-related mortalities, cancer mortalities, deaths due to influenza, heart disease mortalities, diabetes mortalities, homicides and suicides. This helps to show if the races are putting themselves at risk with the risk factors, if they are put at a disadvantage due to socio-economic factors, and if there really are significant differences in preventable deaths between these two races. I tested these risks in a series of correlations.
