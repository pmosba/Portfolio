â€‹In this project, I created an image classification program that can easily and accurately distinguish between different articles of clothing to help with e-commerce websites and their filters for customers. Most websites allow a customer to put a filter on a search in order to find a particular item or color. One way that online businesses can do this is by establishing and incorporating an image classification program.
